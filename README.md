STAlagmite dating by Radiocarbon (star): a software tool for reliable and fast age depth modelling

The software comes along with the following publication:
Fohlmeister, J., Lechleitner, F.A., STAlagmite dating by Radiocarbon (star): a software tool for 
reliable and fast age depth modelling, Quaternary Geochronology, submitted

Please cite the paper if you are using this fantastic software. ;)



Please read the paper before considering this software to construct an age-depth model for your climate archive.

A one-page manual is provided for a quick start. Please read this. Afterwards you should be able to handle the 
most important features of 'star' and application of your dataset shouldn't be a problem anymore.
