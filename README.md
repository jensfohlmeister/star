STAlagmite dating by Radiocarbon (star): a software tool for reliable and fast age depth modelling

The software comes along with the following publication:
Fohlmeister, J., Lechleitner, F.A., 2019, STAlagmite dating by Radiocarbon (star): a software tool for 
reliable and fast age depth modelling, Quaternary Geochronology 51, 120-129.

based on previous work, presented in:

Lechleitner, F. A., Fohlmeister, J., McIntyre, C., Baldini, L., Jamieson, R. A., Hercman, H., Gasiorowski, M., Pawlak, J., Stefaniak, K., Socha, P., Eglinton, T. I., Baldini, J. U. L., 2016. A novel approach for reconstruction of accurate radiocarbon-based chronologies for speleothems. Quaternary Geochronology 35, 54-66.

Please cite the paper(s) if you are using this fantastic software. ;)



Please read the paper before considering this software to construct an age-depth model for your climate archive.

A one-page manual is provided for a quick start. Please read this. Afterwards you should be able to handle the 
most important features of 'star' and application of your dataset shouldn't be a problem anymore.
